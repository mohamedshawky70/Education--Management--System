## Project Overview

**Objective:** 
A comprehensive backend API for managing educational institutions, including students, teachers, departments, subjects, Assignment and enrollments. Built with RESTful principles and JWT authentication.


## Tech Stack
-**Backend**: .NET 9 (Web API)

-**Database**: SQL Server 

-**Authentication**: Secure access to surveys and responses using JWT token and refresh token authentication 

-**ORM**: Entity Framework Core for database interactions

## Key Features
-**üîí User and Role Management**: Leveraged JWT for secure authentication and authorization, allowing for seamless and secure access control.

-**üìù Audit Logging**: Implemented audit logging to track changes on resources, ensuring transparency and accountability in user actions.

-**üö® Exception Handling**: Integrated centralized exception handling to manage errors gracefully, significantly enhancing the user experience.

-**‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling with Result Pattern**: Employed a result pattern for structured error handling, providing clear and actionable feedback to users.

-**üö¶CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. 

-**üîÑ Automapper/Mapster**: Utilized for efficient object mapping between models, improving data handling and reducing boilerplate code.

-**‚úÖ Fluent Validation**: Ensured data integrity by effectively validating inputs, leading to user-friendly error messages.
